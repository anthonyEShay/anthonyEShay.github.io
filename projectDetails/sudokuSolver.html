                <h3>About the Sudoku Solver Program</h3>
            <p>This python based program is a theoretical hypothesis testing based program that served as the final project for my Advanced Artificial Intelligence graduate level course. Using a backtracking algorithm with added constraint satisfaction testing can easily solve substantially sized Sudoku puzzles as long as they are correctly designed to have only one possible solution. This is especially true when multi-threading is taken advantage of. Backtracking begins to fall apart when some of the given data points begin to be excluded. This causes the puzzle to gain multiple correct solutions and quickly begins to exponentiate the amount of permutations the algorithm must test.</p>
                <p>My theory was that one possible way to solve this problem is to make use of a genetic algorithm. This style of algorithm could potentially eliminate much of the problems caused from missing initial information by genetically coming up with a correct or nearly correct solution. In the case of a nearly correct solution a backtracking algorithm could then be used to eliminate the need for the genetic algorithm to converge on a correct solution. The project ended up being a moderate success. The premise worked but running the algorithm took a substantial amount of time. While improvements certainly can be made to speed up execution, the ultimate usefulness of combining these two algorithms together in this application remains to be seen.</p>
