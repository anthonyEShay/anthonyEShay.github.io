            <h3>About the Website</h3>
			<p>This website is designed to showcase some exciting projects I have worked on in my journey to become a skilled programmer. These projects demonstrate my coding abilities in Python, JavaScript, Html/Css, and my ability to apply concepts such as sorting, searching, and multithreading to the programs I write. This portfolio website is static and built entirely with Html, Css, and JavaScript. The intent was to build a site that has an easy to understand and grasp layout, allows for a smooth and responsive user experience, and loads quickly. The website is easily navigated with the menu on the left side. The resume page includes an easy to view html resume that can be downloaded as a pdf . The projects page includes several projects, some of which are web based and can be tried from this site.</p>
            
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My passions are programming and advancing the capacities of artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in systems programming, algorithms, and multi-threading applications. I am looking for an opportunity to use  my skills  in an innovative and cutting edge company that embraces  the latest technologies and seeks  to create unique and world changing applications. Now more than ever, I think we can improve the world by harnessing the promise of AI.</p>
