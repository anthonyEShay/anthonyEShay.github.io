			<p>I am a recent Master of Science in computer science graduate from California State University East Bay. While at CSU East Bay I was very interested in Artificial Intelligence, systems programming, algorithms, and multi-threading applications. While these topics gripped my curiosity, my passion quickly became teaching. I was given the opportunity to teach undergraduate laboratory classes and found it an extremely rewarding experience. While I can see myself teaching in the future I am first looking for an opportunity to grow my skill sets in the field. I long to see and experience how everything I leaned while earning my Masters degree is being applied in the real world. I would love for the chance to work at an innovative and cutting edge company that is using all of the latest technologies at their disposal to create unique and world changing applications.</p>
            
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <br>
            <p>My original life plan led me to earn a BS in Biology with a Minor in History from UCSB. While very interesting I quickly learned that the field of Biology was not where I was meant to work. I had always enjoyed playing with computers and various programs and so I decided to take classes at the local community college during my free time. This is when I found programming and all of computer science to be extremely interesting and fulfilling. I quickly decided to earn a Masters degree and was accepted into CSU East Bay. While earning my Masters degree I decided to earn a general CS degree so that I could take a wide variety of different classes. Because of this I was able to take classes about Artificial Intelligence, computer architecture, systems programming, algorithms, networking, and more.</p>
            
            <p>While earning my masterâ€™s degree, I was invited by one of my faculty, Prof. Stalica, to teach his undergraduate laboratory classes and grade for his Artificial Intelligence classes. These full length laboratory classes were run in conjunction with a separate lecture portion. To give the best experience to my students at CSUEB, I tracked the lecture material to make sure my labs reinforced and built upon that material to ensure that students were understanding it and keeping up. I was given some freedom in how the labs were to be run and so leading a lab gave me the opportunity to design my own challenging yet rewarding assignments, fair quizzes, and develop my ability to teach computer science topics to students who were new to the field. In light of the COVID-19 global pandemic, CSUEB switched in March 2020 to a virtual mode of instruction. Despite being quite the sudden change I found that I was able to adapt and excel at teaching a completely online lab for my CSUEB undergraduate students.</p>
            
            <p>Having now finished a rewarding year and a half of grading/TAing at CSUEB I am now looking to grow as a programmer and expand my skill sets in a non-academic setting. I have learned much about many different topics and dived deep into the academic thought that went into many of the algorithms and processes that build up large coding projects like operating systems. Despite this my chances to actually apply that knowledge have been limited. I would love for the opportunity to join a cutting edge company that is using modern coding methods in their day to day tasks. I believe my education and experiences will allow me to be a helpful member to any team that is willing to let me contribute. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for taking the time to view my website and for your consideration of my application.</p>
            
            <p>Best Regards,</p>
            <p>Anthony Shay</p>
