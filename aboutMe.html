			<p>I am a recent Master of Science in computer science graduate from the California State University East Bay. While at CSU East Bay I was very interested in Artificial Intelligence, systems programming, algorithms, and multi-threading applications. While these topics gripped my curiosity my passion quickly became teaching. I was given the opportunity to teach undergraduate laboratory classes and found it an extremely rewarding experience. While I can see myself teaching in the future I am currently first looking for an opportunity to grow my skill sets in the field. I long to see and experience how everything I leaned while earning my Masters degree is being applied in the real world. I would love for the chance to work at an innovative and cutting edge company that is using all of the latest technologies at their disposal to create unique and world changing applications.</p>
            
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>While earning my Masters degree I decided to earn a general CS degree so that I could take a wide variety of different classes. Because of this I was able to take classes about basic Artificial Intelligence</p>
            <p>Talk more in depth about teaching experience and how was flexible enough to adapt to covid stuff.</p>
